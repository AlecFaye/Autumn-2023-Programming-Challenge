# Games Job Fair Autumn 2023 - Unity Programming Challenge
Create a game that puts a new twist on a classic concept. You can recreate a classic game with a new twist, or put a classic twist on a classic game form (i.e. platformer, puzzle, rpg).

The game must:
- Have some kind of UI that displays information pertinent to the player experience (health, score, level whatever fits).
- Have a complete gameplay loop (running, game over)
