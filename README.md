# Games Job Fair Autumn 2023 - Unity Programming Challenge

This game was created for the Games Job Fair Autumn 2023 Programming Challenge. The theme was taking a classic game and adding a twist. 

I took the classic game chess and added a rock, paper, scissors element to the game. If you beat a piece with the right element, you can go again. If you bear a piece with the wrong element, you lose your piece as well. 

Note: You play for both sides. I did not have time to implement an AI to play the other side.
